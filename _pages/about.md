I am masters student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and University of Montreal working on robot learning under supervision of Prof. Liam Paull. 
My short term reserach interest is making deep learning methods for robotics probabilistic. 

Before joining as masters student, I was an intern for a year under Prof. Liam Paull. Before that I was undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur, where I spent most of my time
at [AGV](http://www.agv.iitkgp.ac.in/) working on perception and embbeded-control systems for autonomous vehicles.

I am a avid chess player (not professionally).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
